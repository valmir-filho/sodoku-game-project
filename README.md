## Instructions:

- Install Python: First, ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/);

- Verify Python Installation: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and run python3 --version;

- Install Pygame: Now, install Pygame using pip. In the terminal, run pip3 install pygame;

- Create the Game File: Open a text editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, or even Notepad);
  
- Copy the Python code (sodoku_game.py) into the editor;

- Save the file as sodoku_game.py;

- Run the Game: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and navigate to the directory where you saved sodoku_game.py;

- Run the game with: python3 sodoku_game.py.

## Game Instructions:

- Fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also called boxes) contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating any numbers;

- The Sudoku grid consists of 9 rows, 9 columns, and 9 smaller 3x3 grids;

- Some cells will already be filled with numbers. Use these as clues to solve the puzzle;

- Each number (1-9) must appear exactly once in each row;
 
- Each number must appear exactly once in each column;

- Each number must appear exactly once in each 3x3 grid;

- You can fill empty cells with numbers as long as they donâ€™t violate the rules above;

- Use logic and deduction to determine where each number belongs;

- If you get stuck, you can use trial and error to test possibilities;

- Focus on rows, columns, or boxes with the most filled cells to find possible numbers;

- If a number can only fit in one cell in a row, column, or box, place it there;

- If you're unsure, you can make small notes in cells for possible numbers;

- You win by correctly filling in all the cells in the grid according to the rules.

### Used IDE: Visual Studio Code.
